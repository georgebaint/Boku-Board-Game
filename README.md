This project is an implementation of the board game "BOKU".

BOKU has two main rules:

1)The game is won by putting five marbles into a row

2)If a player traps two of his opponent's marbles between two of his own, he may remove one of the sandwiched marbles (and the opponent may not put a marble back into the same place with his next move).

Uppon launching Executable.exe the player can choose to play vs another player locally or vs an AI opponent.
